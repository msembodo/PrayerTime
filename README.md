ï»¿Muslims' prayer time in command line

This command line tool will display prayer times for actual date in a desired local time. Since it takes location string as argument, the location needs to be in quotation mark and it can be as simple as -- for example 'houston, US', or a bit more detail like 'pulo gebang, cakung, jakarta, indonesia'. As it uses Google Maps API to get latitude and longitude, more accurate location may give more precise prayer time.
